# Power House Visitor Centre
> @Stave lake

It's facinating to learn the details about hydro power, and interworkings of giant mechineries. Especially how governor control the rotation to 225 to answer the different level of power request from the city.
## Learning
* The dedicated tooling for specific tasks around that age is very enjoyful to observe.  Many things could have been done with 1 button in modern electronics/ softwares takes shoe box size devices to get 1 reading. I defintely have more respect for the Engineers around that time.
* Fine tuning the pitch angle of wind turbine is a very good task for small scale ML model.

## TODO
We spent extra $2 for further visiting before thanks giving.
