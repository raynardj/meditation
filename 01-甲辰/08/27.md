# Meeting
During an 1 on 1 meeting, we need to align an idea.

I understand most of that person's idea, he didn't understand my idea well.

But from the tone I can hear, he assumes I can not catch up with his idea.

It went on for a while, 2 of us got inpatient and agitated.

I gradually change into a more appreciating tone, not very willing of course.

And after 10 minutes, both of us like each other's idea much better, and exited about the feature we are going to build.

## Learning
* Even if we are sure our audience know less or pondered less on the subject, revealing this in the tones never help.
