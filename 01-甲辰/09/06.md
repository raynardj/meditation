# Egypt
I see Dean's photo in Egypt, especially the one under pyramid.

I realize he traveled more than most of my friends. Will play catch up when Âµ can come along.

# Appearance Feature
I start the day with the intention to render a long video.

I realize I under estimate the scope after 30 minutes. I have to put in a easy scene change detector.

So I spent most of my day doing this. It's still exciting to code and visualize result within single working day.

# Focus
It's either I focus a lot on my work & school, fulfilled. But agitated at arrangements in my life.

Or enjoying my life, feel relaxed, but can't dive deep into work details.
