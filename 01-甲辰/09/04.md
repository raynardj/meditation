# Happiness
Today I work, I play with kid, I study, I exercise. Uneventful.

But it feels like a really unhappy, stretched, unfulfiled and agitated day.

Maybe it's too much things to catch up at work. Bluring the line of controllable things or not.

Maybe it's constant distraction while working.

Maybe it's too crowded at home, we should live in at least a townhouse given the head count. Random information just pop up too freequent for WFH.

Maybe it's temperature.

# Quotes
Many problem don't have solutions, especially perfect ones, but that's not the execuse for inaction. Doing anything helps shaping the path.
