# Odyssey

I'm not sure any more.

Yes now I get this is a technology stunt, for the marvels that not many others can do, we didn't forget that we should sell to custormer, but I was under the wrong impression that She wasn't designed to.

I was under the wrong impression that whatever the gap between the current status and the most advanced sales robot online, will be bridged by the collective talents we have. Since we never imagined so many other details would be the hard part.

I have no idea, in a year, the story can turn out like this. I feel somewhere guilty that I have dragged resource, hours, and some people's career into this long night depicted as a saga. The depth of darkness we are in right now.

Only this time last year, we were not fettered by the bounding limits, not burdened by the martyred friends, under the context that no other company has done this before. I can't help but miss the blinding confidence we had.

# Dichotomy of Control
When time is bad, we are easy to blame every imbiciles and evils who shaped it.

## I can control
