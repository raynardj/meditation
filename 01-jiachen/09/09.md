# Pipeline Setback
One of the easy pipeline I guessed turned out to be very tricky. Fixed some of the bugs, but still not decent value.

So many tools can help and automate in recent years. But still so few time to explore.

With the current interruptions at home I even thought about work at a wework desk.

# Going back
I thought about going back, leave everything behind. Just so sick of keeping an eye on the immigration policies.

It's a great illustration for the saying:

If we keep getting upset by someone else's stupidity, we will be angry all the time.

# Learning

Learning, in essence, is the action to know and practice out side of comfort zone.

Even if you are reading and practicing calculus, if it's just to see you can get the 99% right over and over, you are NOT learning.
