# Nightmare

J had a nightmare about both of us got layoff before we got PR. That kept her from thinking about paddling board.

That thought made her reconsider our current situation.

I immediately sell her the idea of benefit from imagining adversity in life.

It's very healthy to practice that thinking in life, make us cherish what we have for now. And we can tune our purpose more truly to our heart.

# Learning
Me & H agreed, or at least I planned, I should coffee chat with more people accross the industries to learn how things work (once I got the master degree next June). Especially from yesterday's experience, it's very good brain exercise to learn new aspects of business and engineering with certain complexity within a very short frame of time.

# Traveling
Dean is very much inspired by traveling to Egypt, and reach into the concusion that China is pretty nice for many good metrics. The diet and other life condition of middle east country, when witness with own eyes can leave a huge shock to people.
