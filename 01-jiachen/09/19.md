# Downtown Event

I'm surprised my wife enjoyed this social event more than I do, should encourage her more on this.

I see people love to talk about their struggle and how they prevail, across different genders, all true.

Different speakers talked about different struggles, the best ones are the ones with great story telling skill.

As a guy who shall not interrupt during a women's event, I do get the good opportunity to observe closely how audience react with mentors, here's what I found:

* There is a significant portion of people who does not intend to seek career advice & heed at all, though the formality etc.

* Most audiences are more attentive during the social round. As I can see most are more happy. Great value it brings to people's life. I even see people putting down notes much more intensely to write down a list on more events to attend.

I find it more often that, it's much easier to handle her if we lead her to to play and interact with dedicated mind.

If we plan to spend less time and attention, things can get much worse. We even loose the quality time with her.
