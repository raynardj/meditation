# Compliments VS Scolding
Compliments to child might or might not work. But scolding or negative teachings never work. As the kid will dislike the task/merit we wish her to perform.

# Writing/ Relay Ideas
In many jobs involve communication. The main task is to articulate knowledge and idea precisely.

# Learning
The speed of learning is ever increasing as barrier of understanding sophisticate things is lowering face.

Say you're learning something with convoluted concepts that require heavy amount of quanlity answers to your stupid questions. Now LLMs vastly avaiable. 

Or you want to practice some form of coding, but stuck at some very stubborn bug or some of the handy syntax you just doesn't know, there are always very meaningless bugs unrelated to the things you want to learn but preventing your progress of learning.

Now all these barriers are gone.

And we are too terrified to not learning.
