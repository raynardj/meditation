# Party @ Kushal's place
Some impressive details I remember
* Taichi, a Japanese exchange stutdent only reach Canada for half a year, speaks English with no trace of accent. He does have strong preference to mimick persons' tones.
* Ed: Working for Run Diffusion, nice person, gave me a ride, should buy him a drink some time.
* Britney used to disect mice for neural research purpose. One of the sadest thing to her is to kill the mice that trust her the most. The 1st person perception is you live at your home, with god's hand reaching to your place, snatch you up. And next thing you know, you open your eyes and you can't move at all.
* Western people certainly crank up stage movement when singing. It's not often seen with working class country man.
