# MPI
I really start to think the things I pickup at my current master programming is benefiting me.

Especially when the course starts to get interesting. I've touched topics like mpi vaguely for parallel training before, but not digging into the tech stack entirely.

All so when try to rearrange a merge sort into iterator, that I can diy and change a compare function outside of the sorting code. Which is a useful thing if the compare function is a neural network, an idea I mentioned once in on of my essay.

I like how life is not purely ongoing struggle, but good surprises coming out of our persistence.

# Job
Obviously more and more of us are starting to worry about our job. Or our project.

That does push me to listen to more voices, trying to think more solutions.
