# Read
I read [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) today. Resonate with the idea deeply, often speaking out the rephrased version of the ideas.

The post is mentioned in [this video](https://youtu.be/kYWUEV_e2ss) I saw today. One of the quote from the video I like very much:

> I don't know any other trend(computation capacity over the years) that is as strong and longlasting as this one. Whenever I see such incredible trend that is way beyond my intuition, I think about 2 things, 1st I should not compete with this(point at trend), 2nd I want to leverage this as much as possible in every aspect of my career and life.

# Kid
My wife told me, as she read from somewhere else

> Kid being annoying are mostly set to test the boundry/ limit of human interactions.

The idea is to intervene less.

# Improvement
Metrics of improvements:

* Idiot Count: measure the elapse of time that you think yourself by that time is an idiot. The shorter the better.

Career Choice:

Don't choose a shrinking/matured industry, it's not even about money or potential, but you surrounded by less smart people(smart/learning people all left the industry), or by smart people who defend a losing trend as a habbit. It won't give you a growth mindset.
